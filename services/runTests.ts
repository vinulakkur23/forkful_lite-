===============================================

This script runs multiple tests to validate:

2. Session tracking and state reset
3. Photo location extraction
4. Restaurant suggestion functionality

You should see a series of test outputs above.
Review them to ensure all features are working correctly.

MANUAL TESTING CHECKLIST:

1. Location Priority System:
   ✓ Restaurant-selected location takes highest priority
   ✓ Photo location (EXIF/PHAsset) takes second priority 
   ✓ Device location used as fallback

2. PHAsset Location Extraction:
   ✓ App correctly extracts location from PHAsset
   ✓ Falls back to EXIF data when needed
   ✓ Uses device location as last resort

3. Restaurant Suggestions Reset:
   ✓ New photo uploads completely reset all state
   ✓ Each photo has a unique session ID
   ✓ Stale API responses are ignored after photo change

4. User Input Handling:
   ✓ Auto-suggestions don't override active user typing
   ✓ User explicit selections take precedence over auto-suggestions
   ✓ Editing flags are properly tracked and respected

To complete testing, try the following in the app:
1. Upload multiple photos in sequence
2. Verify suggestions don't carry over between photos
3. Start typing in fields to ensure auto-suggestions don't override
4. Select restaurants from the suggestion list
5. Test with photos containing location data
6. Test with photos without location data
