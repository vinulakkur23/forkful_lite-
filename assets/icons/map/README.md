# Map Button Icons

This directory contains custom icons for the map screen buttons:

- `my-location.png`: Icon for the button that centers the map on the user's current location
- `share.png`: Icon for the button that shares the map locations

## Image Requirements

- Format: PNG with transparency
- Recommended size: 24x24 pixels (or 48x48 for @2x)
- Color: White (or transparent with white elements) since the button background is colored

Simply replace these placeholder files with your custom icons while maintaining the same filenames.
