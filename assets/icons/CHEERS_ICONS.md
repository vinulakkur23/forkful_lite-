# Cheers Icons

This directory contains placeholder icons for the cheers functionality:

- `cheers-active.png` - Icon shown when the user has cheered a meal (active state)
- `cheers-inactive.png` - Icon shown when the user hasn't cheered a meal (inactive state)

## Current Status

The current icons are placeholders (copied from star icons). You should replace these with your own custom cheers icons.

## Usage

These icons are used in the MealDetailScreen to show the cheers button next to the meal title. The button only appears for meals that don't belong to the current user.

## Recommended Specifications

- Size: 24x24 points (72x72 pixels for @3x)
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Style: Should match the overall app design
- Active state: Should clearly indicate the "cheered" state
- Inactive state: Should be more subtle/muted

## File Naming Convention

- `cheers-active.png` - for the active/cheered state
- `cheers-inactive.png` - for the inactive/not cheered state

Make sure both files are present as they are required by the cheers functionality.
